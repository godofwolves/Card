                <li>Response when there is no responder - There is never a good place to get hurt but when help is out of reach, a first aid kit is your next best friend.  You can’t always count on others to help so be prepared.</li><br>
    
                <li>We only have so much blood - Scary but true.  If your injury involves blood-loss, you only have precious seconds to get the necessary supplies to stop the bleeding.  Keeping a first aid kit close by can provide the extra time you need to seek help. 
                </li><br>
                <li>Kids will be kids - You can count on kids getting hurt.  Lack of experience or just plain recklessness all add up to someone getting hurt.  Cuts, scrapes and burns are common injuries to expect so prepare a first aid kit with the appropriate supplies.
</li><br>
                <li>Liability - nobody wants to think about being sued.  Businesses are required by law to keep first aid supplies readily available when there is no first response within 10 minutes.  Be sure your first aid kit is stocked with the required ANSI first aid items.
</li><br>
                <li>Protect your employees or people you care about - When an injury occurs, a stocked first aid kit can save someone’s life.  Think about others who are risking injury while on the job and do the right thing.  Let everyone know you have a stocked first aid kit ready to use and tell them where it is in case an accident occurs.
